Association rule mining/ market basket analysis

when u want to buy X, also buy Y (no intention initially but after seeing, then decided) as two products are placed near

Antecedent - buying a phone 
consequent  - buying a screen guard

product placement in retail stores

tie up with other vendor example: buy gym membership and gym with partner with shoe brands and sell

bread and butter , diaper -- bear example


Support: **probability of product being bought
         ** popularity of item in dataset 
         ** b/w 0 and 1

  support     = instances of A / number of instances

only transactions matter not quantity of  products
eg:100 transaction are happening
support for  milk.. how many are milk out of 100 transaction

confidence : **its like conditional probability
             ** how likely A (consequent) is bought if B (antecedent) is purchased
              ** b/w 0 and 1
      confidence (B-->A)  = instances of B and A together/ instances of B  = confidence(A/B)   ...consider like p(A/B) = P(A intersect B)/P(B)
0 -whenever B is bought A is not bought together
1- whenever B is bought A is bought together

Lift: ** is the probability of A being bought given that B is present, taking into account the popularity of A as well.
Lift (B-->A) = confidence  /consequent support   = confidence (B-->A)/ support of A
**  ** b/w 0 and infinity
** indicates association b/w 2 products
** high lift , high signifiant association ---
** high lift means products sold together but are not very popular 
---------------
Summary:

✅ apyori → No one-hot encoding needed. Use lists of item names.

🔲 mlxtend → Requires one-hot encoded DataFrame (pandas) if you're using its Apriori or association_rules functions.

study about get dummies, one hot encoding, multilabelbinarizer
is market basket and assocition rules different

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use TransactionEncoder when:

You have transactional data (e.g., market baskets, purchase logs).

You want to apply Apriori, FP-Growth, or other association rule mining algorithms.

You need to prepare input for mlxtend.frequent_patterns.apriori.

Both do similar things (one-hot encoding of sets), but:

Use this	When your data is...
TransactionEncoder	Transaction-style (market basket, shopping cart)
MultiLabelBinarizer	Multi-label classification (text tags, genres)

1. TransactionEncoder()

Initializes the encoder – it will convert your transactions into a one-hot encoded format.

2. fit(re).transform(re)

fit(re): Learns the unique items from all transactions.

transform(re): Creates a binary (True/False) matrix indicating which items are present in each transaction.
   -------------------------------------------------------
.str.get_dummies() for one hot encoding:

df['Basket_str'] = df['Basket'].apply(lambda x: ','.join(x))
df['Basket_str'].str.get_dummies(sep=',')

You're converting a column of lists (e.g., ['Beer', 'Chips']) into a single string like 'Beer,Chips'.
lambda x: ','.join(x)

This is an anonymous function that:

Takes a list x (e.g., ['Beer', 'Chips'])

Joins the elements with commas: 'Beer,Chips'

----
','.join(x):

join() is a string method.

It joins a list of strings into a single string, with a specified separator.
---
And .str.get_dummies() requires:

A string column, not a list

Items separated by a specific character (like ,)
